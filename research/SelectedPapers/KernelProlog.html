<H2> Abstract</H2>
We extend Horn Clause Prolog with two new primitives, 
<tt>new_engine (+Goal, +Answer, -Engine)</tt> and <tt>new_answer(+Engine, -Answer)</tt>
for creating and exploring answer spaces of multiple interpreters
(engines). 
We show that despite its ontological parsimony, the resulting
language is comparable in practical  expressivness with conventional 
full Prolog, by allowing compact definitions for negation, if-then-else, 
all solution predicates, I/O and reflective meta-interpreters.
While not really needed anymore as a workaround for the lack of 
expressivenes of pure Prolog, a form of dynamic database operations
can be emulated as well, using the state of multiple engines.
With multiple engines laying the foundation for multi-threaded
execution models of logic programming languages, the surprising
result that a minimal extension of Horn Clauses in fact bridges
the gap to full Prolog is significant as a basis for lightweight 
implementations of embedabble logic programming components.
Our constructs have been used in the design of small
footprint mobile code interpreters for a commercial multi-threaded
agent programming language - Jinni - available from 
<b>LINK</b>.

<p>
      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc1.1">
1.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem</H3>
Although Prolog programmers usually agree on how to express 
various algorithms in side-effect free Prolog, a wide diversity 
of opinions exist on how to bridge the semantic gap between
pure Prolog and full Prolog and how software patterns for
pure Prolog can be reused in dealing with real-life
programming (`full Prolog'),
while remaining
as close as possible to the well understood
semantic base of the language.

<p>
A quick look at how beginners evolve into Prolog
programmers mimics quite well the dynamics of the
issues involved. The following pattern, we have 
witnessed a few times during the last two decades
on comp.lang.prolog is tipical.
 
<p>
Once programming without destructive assignment
is understood, the Prolog beginner manages to
build <em>Horn Clause programs</em> relatively well.

<p>
Then he or she hits suddenly the next obstacle:
the problem of <em>information exchange
between different derivations (AND-branches)</em>.

<p>
As Prolog explores different AND-branches through
backtracking, their state is not simultaneously
present. The (unrecommended) approach is
saving state through dynamic database operations.

<p>
This is plagued not only by the loss of declarative
semantics but also with quick deterioration of
operational semantics: non-reentrancy of code, 
sensitivity to CUT, sensitivity to semantics of the underlying 
dynamic database implementation.

<p>
The comp.lang.prolog insider usually preaches abstinence:
such information exchange is better to be avoided. 
Suggestions to handle the problem with negation, setof/bagof constructs,
start to come out. The sudden conspiracy:-) among insiders
is somewhat to forget mentioning that the solutions involve
reexecution of goals, changes in complexity, 
needlessly performing all solution computations etc.

<p>
At this point, there are clear signs that a serious expressivness limit
of the language has been reached.

<p>
The welcome-to-the-club initiation then takes the beginner
to the semantics of database updates and views,
the fineprint specification of setof and bagof, with delicatessen like
the morphing of stack variables into heap variables
in the middle of a the sorting process.
Of course, not being a beginner anymore,
the newly born Prolog insider is ready for the next 
iteration - explaining to other novices where the fun
comes from. 

<p>
It is a fact, at this point, that all the semantic
simplicity of Horn Clause Logic Programming is gone.

<p>
As it is the case with the expressiveness of
Finite State Automata vs Deterministic Finite State Automata, 
it is no secret  that non-deterministic programs give a much simpler 
expression to common algorithms. 
This extends naturally to Horn Clause programs. In fact, 
as shown in [<a href="#TD95:OR" name=CITETD95:OR>TD95</a>], appropriate use of non-determinism 
also leads to better performance models and 
a more predictable real-time behavior by possibly eliminating
garbage collection. 

<p>
As programming gains in genericity and component 
reusability in the procedural,
object oriented and functional paradigms,
the need to combine
answers obtained through different derivations (different AND branches)
the very existence of which makes logic programming different,
is, arguably, instrumental for the survival of logic 
programming languages, as it improves their ability to 
build generic, reusable components.

<p>
However, to be able
to re-use such nondeterministic generators
as components, we need
to control the production of their 
answers and we need 
to be able to consider alternative
solutions together.

<p>
      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc1.2">
1.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The contributions</H3>
We will describe in the paper a shortcut for the problem
of information exchange between AND-derivations, which encourages
using simple non-deterministic generators, encapsulated
as separate engines (Horn Clause interpreters).

<p>
Through a set of suitable abstractions, they will be put to
work as reusable components cooperating through independent
resolution processes.

<p>
While the semantics of a multi-engine program
cannot be expressed in a trivial way in terms
of one-engine Horn Clause 
resolution<a href="#tthFtNtAAB" name=tthFrefAAB><sup>1</sup></a>,
their operational semantics is fairly simple.
Moreover, the usual declarative semantics,
covers pure components running on each engine,
while the more powerful glue language used
to coordinate engines can be kept as a
separate, meta-level component.

<p>
The first contribution of this paper is a new, `axiomatic'
redesign of a language having the expressivenes of
full Prolog on top of Horn Clause Prolog,
using only two predefined operations. Our
design covers negation, limitted prunning through
once/1 and if-then-else/3, all-solution predicates,
I/O and goes beyond standard Prolog
in providing forms of lazy, on-demand generation of
sets of solutions. With these primitives available,
there's no real need for Prolog's cut operation anymore
and the resulting language has the benefit
of allowing program transformations like unfolding
to be performed safely. 

<p>
After filling the semantic
gap between Horn Clause programs and full Prolog,
we further extend the expresiveness of the resulting language
by emulating some basic linear and intitionistic logic
operators and on top of them a higher level <em>answer producer/
answer consumer construct</em> construct.

<p>
The software engineering virtues of intuitionistic
implications for expressing modules and local
information have been advocated by Dale Miller
back in the 80's, during the original design of
Lambda-Prolog [<a href="#Miller89Lex" name=CITEMiller89Lex>Mil89</a>,<a href="#miller:lprolog" name=CITEmiller:lprolog>Mil91</a>] but, unfortunately,
they have not been used yet
in major commercial Prolog implementations or
real life software projects. In this context,
the second contribution of the paper is
exploring the synergy of our `first-order' engines,
with linear and intuitionistic 
assumptions<a href="#tthFtNtAAC" name=tthFrefAAC><sup>2</sup></a>
by designing a high level 
<tt>Answer&lt;=Producer=&#62;Consumer</tt> primitive allowing
alternative OR-answers
from the Producer engine 
to be seen as linear
assumptions by the <tt>Consumer</tt> engine.
The construct works as if goal <tt>Answer1 -o</tt>
<tt>Answer2 -o</tt> ... <tt>-o Consumer</tt> were
executed on <tt>Consumer</tt>'s engine, with <tt>-o</tt> denoting
linear implication and Answer1,Answer2,... being the instances 
of <tt>Answer</tt>, produced by executing <tt>Producer</tt>.  
These operations allow for
a (possible infinite) stream of 
answers of an engine,
computed through alternative derivations,
to be used as needed 
in one and the same derivation
of another engine.

<p>
We have tested our design through two different 
implementations, in the latest versions of 
BinProlog and Jinni, available from
<b>LINK</b>. The <em>engine
operations</em> described in this
paper have been used extensively in implementing
some advanced networking constructs like
mobile code and client/server applications in
[<a href="#tarau:shaker" name=CITEtarau:shaker>Tar99a</a>,<a href="#tmob" name=CITEtmob>TD98</a>,<a href="#T98:jelia" name=CITET98:jelia>Tar98c</a>].

2.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Primitive Engine Operations</H3>
At an abstract level only two new primitive operations
are needed to extend Horn Clause programs with <em>engines</em>.
Each engine works as a separate Horn Clause interpereter.
<em>Engine constructors initialize engines with
a goal and an answer pattern.</em>

<p>
<font size="-1">
<pre>
new_engine(Goal,AnswerPattern,Handle)
</pre></font>

<p>
  creates a new Horn Clause solver, uniquely identified
by Handle, which shares code
with the currently running program and is initialized
with resolvent Goal. AnswerPattern is a term, usually
a list of variables occuring in Goal.
<em>Answer constructors build 
successive answers generated by an engine, on demand.</em>

<p>
<font size="-1">
<pre>
new_answer(Handle,AnswerInstance)
</pre></font>

<p>
  harvests the result of a new AND-branch of the search tree
generated by Goal, as a instance of AnswerPattern. If AnswerPattern is
<b>no</b> that the engine is stopped, otherwise it
returns a new answer, of the form <b>the(AnswerInstance)</b>
or <b>no</b> if no more answers are available. Note that once <b>no</b> has been
returned, all subsequent uses of this primitive will return <b>no</b>.
Note also that no bindings are propagated to the original Goal
or AnswerPattern when <b>new_answer</b> retrieves an answer,
i.e. AnswerInstance is obtained by first standardazing apart
(renaming) the variables in Goal and AnswerPattern, and then
backtracking over its alternative answers in a separate Prolog
interpreter.

<p>
Let us call Kernel Prolog the language obtained
by adding to Horn Clauses (pure Prolog) the two previously
introduced built-in operations <b>new_engine/3</b> and <b>new_answer/2</b>
and an infinite supply of new constant symbols
denoting engines<a href="#tthFtNtAAD" name=tthFrefAAD><sup>3</sup></a>.

<p>
      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc2.2">
2.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Source level extensions through new definitions</H3>

<p>
We will know introduce through definitions
in Kernel Prolog, a number of
predicates known as `impossible to emulate' in
Horn Clause Prolog (except by significantly
lowering the level of abstraction and implementing
something close to a Turing machine).
We have added a <b>K</b> to the usual names of
the primitives, to make the code presented in the paper
runnable directly in BinProlog [<a href="#bp7advanced" name=CITEbp7advanced>Tar98a</a>], 
without name conflicts.

<p>
To make the code actually runnable 
as is<a href="#tthFtNtAAE" name=tthFrefAAE><sup>4</sup></a>, 
the following BinProlog implementation of the two
primitives is provided:

<p>
<font size="-1">
<pre>
new_engineK(Goal,AnswerPattern,Handle):-
  open_engine(Goal,AnswerPattern,Handle).

new_answerK(Engine,Answer):-
  ask_engine(Engine,X)-&#62;Answer=the(X)
; Answer=no.
</pre></font>

<p>
  The previous definitions have shown that the resulting
language subsumes (through user provided definitions)
constructs like negation as failure, if-then-else,
once, <b>copy_term</b> - this justifies the name Kernel
Prolog for the resulting language. As Kernel Prolog
contains negation as failure, following [<a href="#ISOProlog" name=CITEISOProlog>DEDC96</a>]
we can, in principle use it for an executable
specification of full Prolog.

<p>
      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc2.3">
2.3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;A reflective meta-interpreter</H3>

<p>
Finally, let us show that Kernel Prolog
has a simple reflective interpreter
(actually much simpler than full Prolog - which
has to deal with CUT).

<p>
<font size="-1">
<pre>
% basic reflective meta-interpreter

solveK(G):-
  onceK(reduceK(G,NewG)),
  callK(NewG).

% reflective reducer
% the simplest such beast is: reduceK(X,X).

reduceK(G,G):-is_builtin(G).
reduceK(','(A,B),','(solveK(A),solveK(B))).
reduceK(G,','(clause(G,Gs),solveK(Gs))).
</pre></font>

<p>
  The presence of such a simple reflective meta-interpreter makes
Kernel Prolog a very interesting target for program transformations
like unfolding, and in particular, for partial deduction based 
source-level optimizations.

<p>
      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc2.4">
2.4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Emulating dynamic database state with engines</H3>
While not really needed at this point as a workaround 
for the lack of expressivenes of pure Prolog:-), 
let us show how a form of dynamic database operations
can be emulated using the state of multiple engines.

<p>
Apparently, this looks a difficult problem
because <tt>new_engine</tt> and <tt>new_answer</tt> operations provide a fixed
communication flow between the answer producer and the answer
consumer engine. Note however, that we can use the new engine
creation operation to emulate both linear (usable once) and conventional
assert-style operations, by keeping the set of engines representing
references to 'dynamic clauses' on a list, as in:

<p>
<font size="-1">
<pre>
assertK(Clause,Engines,[E|Engines]):-
  new_engineK(repeat,Clause,E).

linear_assertK(Clause,Engines,[E|Engines]):-
  new_engineK(true,Clause,E).

clauseK(Engines,Head,Body):-
  member(E,Engines),
  new_answerK(E,the((Head:-Body))).
</pre></font>

<p>
  The trick in the case of conventional <tt>assertK</tt> is to force
indefinite backtracking inside the producer engine, with
<tt>repeat/0</tt>, a pure predicate defined as <tt>repeat. repeat:-repeat.</tt>

<p>
On the other hand, the usable once, <tt>linear_assertK</tt> operation only executes
the goal <tt>true/0</tt> - and therefore it will only succeed once,
before returning the answer <tt>no</tt>.

<p>
We have not shown how a <tt>retract</tt>-like operation is implemented - but
this can easily achieved by removing the engine reference
from the list of engines, so that <tt>clauseK/3</tt> cannot see it
anymore.
 
<p>
Note that these dynamic database operations are in fact
backtrackable, as they depend on the list of engines
maintained by the consumer program. As such, they
are closer to BinProlog's linear and intuitionistic
assumptions [<a href="#TDF:asian96" name=CITETDF:asian96>TDF96</a>]. Scoped implications (as in Lambda Prolog,
Lygon [<a href="#whilps95" name=CITEwhilps95>WH95</a>], Lolli [<a href="#hodmil:ic94" name=CITEhodmil:ic94>HM94</a>,<a href="#hodas:thesis" name=CITEhodas:thesis>Hod94</a>]) can be implemented using logical varables
to close the scope of an implication<a href="#tthFtNtAAF" name=tthFrefAAF><sup>5</sup></a>.

<p>
However, assuming that engine numbers are allocated in
increasing order or that the list of engines is available
as a global state variable, failure persistent
dynamic database operations can be emulated as well.

<p>
Note that our reflective meta-interpreter can be easily
extended to deal with dynamic clauses, as follows.

<p>
<font size="-1">
<pre>
% extended meta-circular interpreter with
% emulated dynamic clauses

% given a set of engines Es representing
% dynamic clauses, solve the goal G
% based on reflection and use of the 
% new clauses encapsulated in the engines

solveK(Es,G):-
  onceK(reduceK(Es,G,NewG)),
  callK(Es,NewG).

reduceK(_,G,G):-is_builtin(G).
reduceK(Es,','(A,B),','(solveK(Es,A),solveK(Es,B))).
reduceK(Es,G,','(clauseK(Es,G,Gs),solveK(Es,Gs))).

callK(_,G):-callK(G).
callK(Es,G):-clauseK(Es,G,B),callK(Es,B).

<p>
      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc2.5">
2.5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic file and socket I/O in Kernel Prolog</H3>

<p>
Let us now incorporate basic I/O in our design.
Let us supose that 2 reserved engines (<b>stdin, stdout</b>)
are built-in in the interpreter.

<p>
Then basic I/O would look as follows:

<p>
<font size="-1">
<pre>
get_code(X):-new_answer(stdin,Answer),convert_code(Answer,X).

convert_code(the(X),X).
convert_code(no,-1).
  
put_code(X):-new_answer(stdout,X).
</pre></font>

<p>
  Streams used for file and socket I/O can be seen as
special purpose engines with operations like:

<p>
<font size="-1">
<pre>
open_stream(File,Stream):-
  new_engine(file(File),_,Stream).

get_code(Stream,Code):-
  new_answer(Stream,Answer),
  convert_code(Answer,Code).
</pre></font>

<p>
  Note that one can assume that arithmetics is part of 
Kernel Prolog through the usual extension of
Horn Clauses with successor arithmetics.

<p>
With these additions, it turns out that
Kernel Prolog is a fairly expressive languge. 
Unlike pure
Horn Clause Prolog and unlike weaker lanaguges
based on Prolog + negation, which  have been
extensively studied in the past, Kernel Prolog
has enough power to be used as a basis
for building compact Prolog
implementations as well as for 
modular library components.

<p>
      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc2.6">
2.6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Semantic Issues in Kernel Prolog</H3>

<p>
While providing a formal semantics of Kernel
Prolog needs more research and it might need
methods beyond the techniques used for
less expressive logic languages, 
let us give a sketch of the issues involved.

<p>
Note that kernel Prolog is a superset of Horn Clauses with
a form of metacall facility. Related semantic issues have
been studied [<a href="#Warren82" name=CITEWarren82>War81</a>,<a href="#hill:analysis:meta:89" name=CITEhill:analysis:meta:89>HL89</a>] 
and are now fairly well understood.

<p>
Like in the case of <tt>findall</tt>, solutions returned 
from an engine contain new variables. As such,
their formal description cannot be covered through
a straightforward adaptation of work like [<a href="#LL87" name=CITELL87>Llo87</a>,<a href="#Apt90" name=CITEApt90>Apt90</a>].
The issues are in fact similar with those involved
in describing formally AND-parallel execution of
Prolog programs  [<a href="#ShenHSLP91" name=CITEShenHSLP91>SH91</a>,<a href="#pontelli97" name=CITEpontelli97>Pon97</a>],
with resolution theory needing to be adapted
to deal with separate computations of answers
within the same AND-branch.

<p>
Clearly, the two new builtins added to
Horn Clause Prolog lack an obvious declarative
semantics.
 On the other hand, the <em>dialog</em> between 
a <em>master</em> Horn Clause engine
creating a new engine for execution of one of
its subgoals and the <em>slave</em> engine which
returns new answers on demand is well known to
any Prolog user as it is essentially the same as querying
a Prolog interpreter through a toplevel command
interpreter<a href="#tthFtNtAAG" name=tthFrefAAG><sup>6</sup></a>.

<p>
However, in a more declarative framework, 
it can be the case that a suitable semantics for
our engine operations can be given in terms
similar to that of streams in functional 
languages.

<p>
       <H4><A NAME="tth_sEc2.6.1">
2.6.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Multi-threaded execution of Kernel Prolog</H4>

<p>
Although engines were running on separate threads in our
first Jinni implementation of Kernel Prolog, we have
decided later to keep engine operations separate
from the underlaying multi-threading model,
as they are basically orthogonal concepts.

<p>
Still, flexible combination of engines and multi-threading
is possible, with minimal new ontology. 
Let us suppose that two multi-threading control operations
are available:
<font size="-1">
<pre>
% Launches Goal on separate (background) Thread
bg(+Goal,-ThreadHandle)

% waits for Thread to terminate and propagates bindings for JoinPattern
join(+Thread,JoinPattern)
</pre></font>

<p>
Then, something like
<font size="-1">
<pre>
?-new_engine(Goal,Answer,Engine),
  bg(new_answer(Engine),Thread), 
  ...work on something else...,
  join(Thread,Answer),
  ...use Answer...
</pre></font>

<p>
  would allow speculative computation of answers
as well as synchronization and data exchange on completed tasks.
A more flexible communication pattern (which includes coordination
through <em>blackboard constraints</em> [<a href="#tarau:paam99" name=CITEtarau:paam99>Tar99b</a>])
has been implemented in both Jinni and BinProlog.
Expressing such functionality in terms of 'pure' Kernel Prolog 
is subject of ongoing work.

3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Memory managment and performance issues for multiple engine systems</H2>

<p>
As this paper focuses on a logical reconstruction of Prolog on top of
its logical Horn Clause kernel, and not on implementation of engines as such,
we will only overview here a more detailed design
(actually implemented in BinProlog [<a href="#bp7advanced" name=CITEbp7advanced>Tar98a</a>])
which allows precise control on allocation and 
deallocation of memory resources.

<p>
To create a new engine having its own stack group (heap, local stack
and trail) we use:

<p>
<font size="-1">
<pre>
  create_engine(HeapSize,StackSize,TrailSize,Handle)
</pre></font>

<p>
  The Handle is a unique integer denoting the engine for further
processing. To `fuel' the engine with a goal and an expected answer variable
we use:

<p>
<font size="-1">
<pre>
  load_engine(Handle,Goal,AnswerVariable)
</pre></font>

<p>
  No processing, except the initialization of the
engine, takes place and no answer
is returned as result of this operation. 

<p>
To get an answer from the engine we use:
<font size="-1">
<pre>
  ask_engine(Handle,Answer)
</pre></font>

<p>
  When the stream of answers reaches its end, <tt>ask_engine/2</tt>
will simply fail.

<p>
To destroy an engine an free its memory areas we use:

<p>
<font size="-1">
<pre>
  destroy_engine(Handle)
</pre></font>

<p>
  If we want to submit another query before using the
complet stream of answers, it is more efficient to reuse an
existing engine with <tt>load_engine/3</tt>, instead of
destroying it and creating a new one.
It is safe to discard an engine on failure, before retuning the answer
<b>no</b>. It is also safe to discard an engine on  backtracking
over <b>new_egine/3</b>. 

<p>
As engines are assigned to real processors in
multi-threaded in implementations like
BinProlog's new native win32 threads package [<a href="#bp7user" name=CITEbp7user>Tar98b</a>],
this reusability of a
given engine for execution of multiple goals allows
tighter programmer control over the resurces of a system.

<p>
Automatic garbage collection of engines
can be achieved with a simple reference counting 
mechanism or by extending the reachabilty logic of Prolog's 
garbage collector to engine handles.

<p>
In BinProlog, engine creation/destruction
is a constant time operation. In our newer
Jinni implementation [<a href="#tarau:paam99" name=CITEtarau:paam99>Tar99b</a>],
engine memory is also allocated on demand,
through the underlying Java system,
with engine creation requiring small
constant initial space and engines 
being garbage collected automatically.

<p>
Note that it is always possible to move to the underlying 
implementation language frequently used engine operations if 
the (constant) overhead of having them defined at source level
is judged too high.

4.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;A high-level Producer/Consumer interaction pattern</H3>

<p>
We have sketched how linear and intuitionistic implications
can be expressed in Kernel Prolog. To make the code in
the paper fully executable we will use here their 
equivalent BinProlog implementation. 

<p>
We will now show, how, with engines and assumptions,
we can provide a high level, encapsulated Consumer/Producer interaction
pattern.

<p>
Let's start by describing the new construct, through the following example:
<font size="-1">
<pre>
?- answer(X)&lt;=member(X,[1,2,3])=&#62;consumer(Xs),write(Xs),nl.
</pre></font>

<p>
  where <tt>consumer/1</tt> is defined as:

<p>
<font size="-1">
<pre>
consumer([X|Xs]):-answer(X),consumer(Xs).
consumer([]).
</pre></font>

<p>
  will execute exactly as the goal

<p>
<font size="-1">
<pre>
?- answer(1) -o answer(2) -o answer(3) -o consumer(Xs),write(Xs),nl.
</pre></font>

<p>
  in a logic language providing linear implication.

<p>
      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc4.2">
4.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Communication through Linear Assumptions</H3>

<p>
This construct, implemented as
a unique primitive, is based on the synergy between multiple engines
and intuitionistic and linear implications (as well as their continuation
passing couterparts).

<p>
The concrete syntaxe is 
Answer <font face=symbol>Ü</font
> Producer <font face=symbol>Þ</font
> Consumer or
Answer <font face=symbol>Ü</font
> Producer when the Consumer is the (implicit) current
AND-continuation.

<p>
Producer is started on a separate engine. It generates
linear facts of nased on the pattern <tt>Answer</tt>, from computed answers
of Goal, originating from <em>distinct OR-branches</em>.
They are usable by <tt>Consumer</tt> as if they were assumed
through use of linear implication, i.e. they are
consumed one-by-one. This hides the intricacies
of starting a new `orthogonal' logic engine into
a simple, easy to use abstraction.

<p>
The actual implementation is given in the Appendix (see also
file <tt>library/engines.pl</tt>, available 
from the <b>LINK</b> BinProlog
download page).

<p>
The following example shows how an OR-stream of answers,
seen as linear assumptions from an `orthogonal'
engine, can be used in an different AND-branch:

<p>
<font size="-1">
<pre>
?- a(X)&lt;=member(X,[1,2,3])=&#62;(a(A),a(B),a(C),write([A,B,C]),nl).

5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Related work</H2>
Engine-like constructs [<a href="#OzEngines:97" name=CITEOzEngines:97>Sch97</a>] have been part of systems like Oz [<a href="#distoz97" name=CITEdistoz97>HVRS97</a>,<a href="#DOZmobs" name=CITEDOZmobs>VRHB<sup>+</sup>97</a>]
and have been used in the past for encapsulated search - arguably more
flexible than Prolog's fixed search mechanism. 
The main differences with our engines come from their different intended use:

<UL>
<p>

<li> Oz engines are not separated from the underlaying multi-threading model

<li> Oz engines are not simple Horn Clause processors, they are part of Oz's more complex, multi-paradigm execution model

<li> Oz engines are used for a different purpose, i.e. to program alternative search algorithms or visual debuggers, while
our objective in this paper is a reconstruction of Prolog based on a Horn Clause kernel
</UL>
<p>
  New languages based on relatively pure subsets of Prolog like 
Mercury [<a href="#mercury" name=CITEmercury>SHC98</a>]
have been designed as targets of more efficient implementation 
technologies and for their reliability in building large software systems.
Flexible execution order is being used in systems like SICStus, GNU-Prolog and B-Prolog
to support constraint solving and in systems like XSB for synchronizing answer production
and answer consumption in tabling.
While Horn Clauses with negation have been extensively studied and
some of the techniques described in this paper might be well known to experienced Prolog
programmers, the very idea of systematically exploring the gains in expressive prower
as a result of having multiple pure Prolog interpreters as
first order objects, has not been explored yet, to our best knowledge.
While our techniques have been described in a BinProlog context,
they can be ported to any Prolog or Prolog-like language
implementation which is <em>reentrant</em> - i.e. able to run more than one instance
of the interpreter or runtime system at the same time - a requierment also
for supporting native multi-threading.

6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Future work</H2>

<p>
The advent of component based software development and intelligent appliances
requiring small, special purpose, self contained, still powerful processing elements,
makes Kernel Prolog an appealing implementation technique for building logic prgramming
components. In particular, in the case of small, wireless interconnected devices,
subject to severe memory and bandwidth limitations, compact and orthogonally designed
small language processors are instrumental. Our ongoing commercial Palm Prolog
implementation will use a fast Horn Clause only reentrant emulator, to be extended
towards full Prolog based on the Kernel Prolog design described in this paper.

<p>
Here are a few open issues and some ongoing or projected related developments:

<p>

<UL>
<li> a study of Kernel Prolog's invariance under program transformations (unfolding)

<li> expressivenes of multi-engine Datalog (conjectured as being Turing-equivalent)

7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</H2>
First order logic engines are introduced to overcome two major
expressiveness problems of pure logic programming languages: 
the inability to abstractly specify communication between distinct
OR-branches and the ability to
describe at source level various non-sequential execution models.
We have shown also that meta-programming and dynamic database
operations are easily emulated in Kernel Prolog.
By collapsing the semantic gap between Horn Clause logic
and (most of) the full Prolog language into two surprisingly
simple, yet very powerful operations, we hope to open the
doors not only for an implementation technology for a new
generation of lightweight Prolog processors but also
towards a better understanding of the intrinsic elegance hiding
behind the core concepts of the logic programming paradigm.
