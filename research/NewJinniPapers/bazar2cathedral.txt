Agent Programming: form the Bazar to the Cathedral

Abstract:

We argue that the bazar looking landscape of
message passing agent programming constructs 
should evolve into a more structured blackboard
based and inference enabled component technology.

Introduction

The first thing that strikes someone looking into
KQML-style agent scripts is the tediousness of
communication between agents - reminding the 
colorful chaos and redundancy of a bazaar
where everyone tries to explain, argue and
negotiate instead of actually getting 
business done. Message passing based agent
communication is dominated by frivolous
exchanges focusing on the protocol
instead of the work to be performed.

Inference and wisdom hint towards cathedrals

Excessive communication is often an indication of
limited intelligence and automation. Inferential
mechanisms will enable agents to avoid asking each
other the obvious - very much like wise people do.
This also means that autonomous search mechanisms,
associative processing of events and data records
is needed. And well known contexts, which reify
intelligence in their structure - cathedrals
with crisp architectural rules - meant to keep
components wise and mostly silent - are the natural
replacement of obnoxious agent bazars. 

The means

A distributed agent architecture like Jinni 2002
providing blackboards and object oriented program
structuring together with strong inferential
capabilities coming from logic programming.
