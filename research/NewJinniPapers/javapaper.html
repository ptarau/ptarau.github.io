<H2> Abstract</H2>
In the context of direct and reflection based extension mechanisms
for the Jinni 2000 Java based Prolog system, we discuss the design and 
the implementation of a reflection based
Prolog to Java interface. While the presence of dynamic type information
on both the Prolog and the Java sides allows us to automate data
conversion between method parameters, the presence of subtyping and 
method overloading makes finding the most specific
method corresponding to a Prolog call pattern fairly difficult.
We describe a run-time algorithm which closely mimics Java's own
compile-time method dispatching mechanism and provides
accurate handling of overloaded methods beyond the reflection
package's limitations. As an application of our interfacing
technique, a complete GUI library is built in Prolog using
only 10 lines of application specific Java code.

1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</H2>

<p>
In this paper, we discuss the extension of the Jinni 2000 Java based
Prolog system [<a href="#tarau:shaker" name=CITEtarau:shaker>6</a>,<a href="#tarau:cl2000" name=CITEtarau:cl2000>8</a>] with a reflection based generic Java Interface.
After overviewing the Jinni architecture we
describe the Prolog API (Application Programmer Interface) used to invoke Java code
and the mapping mechanism between Prolog terms and their
Java representations. We next discuss the implementation of  a reflection based
Prolog-to-Java interface. We will overcome some key
limitations of Java's Reflection package (a Java API
which accesses Java objects and classes dynamically). 
The main problem comes from the fact that reflection does its work at run time.
Although the called classes have been compiled - the invoking code needs to
determine a (possibly overloaded) method's signature dynamically - something 
that Java itself does through fairly extensive compile time analysis. 
First, we discuss the desired functionality 
provided by Java at compile time and explain it through a simple example.
Subsequently, we provide the algorithm behind our implementation, which achieves at 
runtime the functionality that Java provides at compile time. We
also show  some nice properties of our algorithm such as low 
computational complexity. Finally we describe an example application (a GUI for Jinni) 
developed almost completely in Prolog using the reflection API. 

<p>

<b>The Method Signature Problem&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
Most modern 
languages support method overloading (the practice of having more than one 
method with same name). In Java this also interacts
with the possibility of having some methods located in super classes 
on the inheritance chain. 
On a call to an overloaded method, the resolution of which method is to be invoked is based
on the method signature. Method signature is defined as the name of the
method, its parameter types and its return type<a href="#tthFtNtAAB" name=tthFrefAAB><sup>1</sup></a>.

<p>
<em>The problem initially seems simple: just look for the methods with the same name as call, 
number and type of parameters as the arguments in the call and pick that method.</em>

<p>
The actual problem arises because Java allows <em>method invocation type 
conversion</em>. In other words this means that we are not looking for an exact
match in the type of a parameter and the corresponding argument, but we say it is
a match if the type of argument can be converted to the type of a corresponding parameter
by method invocation conversion [<a href="#javaspec" name=CITEjavaspec>2</a>]. Apparently, this also does not seem to be 
very complicated: we just check if the argument type converts to the corresponding parameter
type or not. The problem arises because we may find several such matches and
we have to search among these matches the <b>most specific method</b> - as Java
does through compile time analysis. If such a method
exists, then that is the one we invoke. However, should this search fail,
an error has to be reported 
stating that no single method can be classified as the most specific method.

<p>
This paper will propose a comprehensive solution to this problem, in the context
of the automation of type conversions in Jinni 2000's bidirectional Prolog to Java interface.

<p>
        <H2><A NAME="tth_sEc2">
2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jinni Architecture</H2>

<p>
Jinni 2000 consists of a combination of fast WAM based Prolog engines
using integer arrays for WAM data areas together with a Java class based
term hierarchy - on which runs a lightweight Java based Interpreter,
interoperating with the internal tagged integer based WAM representation,
through an automated bidirectional data conversion mechanism.

<p>
Jinni's Java interface is more flexible and uses programmer- friendly
Java class hierarchy of its interpreted Kernel Prolog [<a href="#tarau:cl2000" name=CITEtarau:cl2000>8</a>] engines,
instead of the high performance but fairly complex integer
based term representations of its WAM based BinProlog-style
engines [<a href="#tdb95rev" name=CITEtdb95rev>9</a>].

<p>
In this section we will explain the mapping from Prolog term 
types to Java classes.

      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc2.1">
2.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Term Hierarchy</H3>
The base class is <b>Term</b> which has two subclasses: <b>Var</b> and <b>NonVar</b>. The <b>NonVar</b>
class is in turn extended by <b>Num</b>, <b>JavaObject</b> and <b>Const</b>. Num is extended
by <b>Integer</b> and <b>Real</b>. <b>Term</b> represents the generic Prolog term which is a
finite tree with unification operation distributed across data types - in
a truly object oriented style [<a href="#tarau:shaker" name=CITEtarau:shaker>6</a>]. The <b>Var</b> class represents a Prolog variable. The 
<b>Integer</b> and <b>Real</b> are the Prolog Numbers. <b>Const</b> represents all symbolic Prolog constants,
with the compound term (called <em>functor</em> in Prolog) constructor class <b>Fun</b> 
designed as an extension of <b>Const</b>.

<p>
<b>JavaObject</b> is also a subclass of <b>Const</b> which unifies only with itself<a href="#tthFtNtAAC" name=tthFrefAAC><sup>2</sup></a>
and is used like a wrapper around Objects in Java to represent Prolog predicates.

<p>
      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc2.2">
2.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Builtin Registration Mechanism</H3>
Jinni's Builtins class is a specialized subclass of Java's Hashtable class.
Every new component we add to Jinni 2000 can provide its own builtin predicates
 as a subclass  of the Builtins class. Each added component will have many
predicates, which are to be stored in this Hashtable mapping their Prolog representation
 to their Java code, for fast lookup.  Let us assume the Prolog predicate's name
is <em>prologName</em> and the corresponding Java classes name is <em>javaName</em>.
We make a class called <em>javaName</em> which extends FunBuiltin (a descendant of 
Term with which we represent a Prolog functor (compound term). It accepts a string (the functor's name)
and an integer in its constructor (arity). 
When we call the <b>register</b> method of the
appropriate descendant of the Builtins class, a 
new Hashtable entry is generated with the supplied  <em>prologName</em> 
and the arity as key and <em>javaName</em> as its value. Whenever the Prolog predicate <em>prologName</em>
with appropriate arity is called, we can look up in constant time which class (<em>javaName</em>) 
actually implements the <b>exec</b> method of the builtin predicate in Java.
Each component extending the Builtins class will bring new such predicates and they 
will be added to the inherited Hashtable with the mechanism described above - and therefore
will be usable as Prolog builtins as if they were part of the Jinni 2000 kernel.

<p>
      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc2.3">
2.3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Builtin Execution Mechanism</H3>
The descendents of the <b>FunBuiltin</b> class implement builtins which pass parameters, 
while the descendents of the <b>ConstBuiltin</b> class implment parameterless builtins.
Both <b>FunBuiltin</b> and <b>ConstBuiltin</b> have an abstract method called <b>exec</b> to be
be implemented by the descendent  <em>javaName</em> class. This is the method that is actually 
mapped to the Prolog builtin predicate with <em>prologName</em> and gets invoked on execution 
of the predicate. The <b>exec</b> method implemented by the <em>javaName</em> class
will get arguments (<b>Term</b> and its subclasses) from the predicate instance using  
<b>getArg</b> methods and will descover their dynamic through a specialized method.
Once we have the arguments and know their
types we can do the required processing. The <b>putArg</b> method, used
to return or check values, uses the <b>unify</b> method of 
Terms and its subclasses to communicate with the actual (possible variable)
predicate arguments. 
On success this method returns <b>1</b>. If putArg does not fail for any
argument the exec method returns <b>1</b>, which is interpreted as a 
<b>success</b> by Prolog. If at least one unification fails we return <b>0</b>, which is 
interpreted as a <b>failure</b> by Prolog. We call this mapping a <em>conventional builtin</em> 
as this looks like a builtin from Prolog side, which is known at compile time and
can be seen as part of the Prolog kernel.

<p>
        <H2><A NAME="tth_sEc3">
3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The reflection based Jinni 2000 Java Interface API</H2>
Our reflection based Jinni 2000 Java Interface API is provided through
a surprisingly small number of conventional Jinni builtins. This property
is shared with the JIPL [<a href="#JIPL" name=CITEJIPL>3</a>] interface from C-based Prologs to Java.
The similarity comes ultimately from the fact that Java's reflection
package exhibits to Java the same view provided to C functions by JNI - the Java 
Native Interface:<br><br>
<b>new_java_class(+'ClassName',-Class).</b><br>

<p>
This takes in as first argument the name of the class as a constant. If
a class with that name is found it loads the class and a handle to this
class is returned in the second argument wrapped inside our <em>JavaObject</em>. 
Now this handle can be used to instantiate objects.<br><br>
<b>new_java_obj(+Class,-Obj):-new_java_obj(Class,new,Obj).</b><br>
<b>new_java_obj(+Class,+new(parameters),-Obj).</b><br>

<p>
This takes in as the first argument a Java <b>class</b> wrapped inside our <em>JavaObject</em>.
In the case of a <em>constructor</em> with parameters, the second argument consists of <b>new</b> and parameters 
(Prolog numeric or string constants or other objects wrapped as <em>JavaObjects</em>) for the
constructor. As with ordinary methods, the (most specific constructor) corresponding to the argument types 
is searched and invoked.
This returns a handle to the new object thus created again wrapped in <em>JavaObject</em> in the 
last argument of the predicate.  If the second parameter is missing then the void constructor 
is invoked. The handle returned can be used to invoke methods:
<b>invoke_java_method( +Object, +methodname(parameters), -ReturnValue).</b>

<p>
This takes in as the first argument a Java class's instantiated
object (wrapped in <em>JavaObject</em>), and the method name with parameters (these
can again be numerical or, string constants or objects wrapped as <em>JavaObjects</em>) in the second
argument. If we find such an (accesible and unambigously most specific)
 method for the given object, then that method
is invoked and the return value is put in the last argument. If the return
value is a number or a string constant it is returned as a Prolog number
or constant else it is returned wrapped as a <em>JavaObject</em>.

<p>
<em>If we wish to invoke static methods the first argument needs to be a class 
wrapped in JavaObject - otherwise the calling mechanis is the same</em>

<p>
The mapping of datatypes between Prolog and Java looks like this:

4.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating a class</H3>
The reflection package uses the Java reflection API to load Java classes
at runtime, instantiate their objects and invoke methods of both classes
and objects. The Java Reflection <em>Class.forName("classname")</em> method is used to 
create a class at runtime. In case an exception occurs, an error message stating the
exception is printed out and a <b>0</b> is returned, which is interpreted as a
<b>failure</b> by Prolog. The error message printing can be switched on/off by
using a flag.
 
<p>
This is interfaced with Prolog using the conventional  Builtin extension mechanism
getting the first argument passed as a Prolog constant seen by Java as a String.
After this, the Java side processing is done and the handle to the required class is obtained.
Finally this handle wrapped as a <em>JavaObject</em> is returned in the second argument.<br><br>
<b>Example:</b><br>
<em>new_java_class('java.lang.String',S)</em><br>
<b>Output:</b><br>
<em>S=JavaObject(java.lang.Class_623467)</em>

<p>
      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc4.2">
4.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Instantiating an Object</H3>
First of all, the arguments of a constructor are converted into a list, then
parsed in Prolog and provided to Java as <em>JavaObjects</em>. Then each one
is extracted individually. If the parameter list is empty then a
special token is passed instead of the JavaObject, which tells the program, that 
a void constructor is to be used to instantiate a new object from the class. 
This is done by invoking the given class' <em>newInstance()</em> method, which returns the
required object.

<p>
If the argument list is not empty, the class (dynamic type) of the objects on the argument
list is determined using the <em>getClass()</em> method and stored in an array.
This array is  used to search the required constructor for the given
class using the <em>getConstructor(parameterTypes)</em> method. Once the
constructor is obtained, its <em>newInstance(parameterList)</em> method is invoked
to obtain the required object. The exception mechanism is exactly the
same as for creating a new class as explained above. 

<p>
This also uses the conventional Builtin extension mechanism to interface with Java, therefore 
Objects are wrapped as <em>JavaObjects</em>. Prolog <b>Integers</b> are mapped to Java <b>int</b> and 
Prolog's <b>Real</b> type becomes Java <b>double</b>. The reverse mapping from
Java is slightly different as <b>long</b>, <b>int</b>, <b>short</b> are mapped to Prolog's
<b>Int</b>, which holds its data in a <b>long</b> field and the <b>float</b> and <b>double</b>
types are mapped to Prolog's Real (which holds is data in adouble field). Java
Strings are mapped to Prolog constants and vice versa (this is symmetric).<br><br>
<b>Example:</b><br>
<em>new_java_obj(S,new(hello),Mystring)</em><br>
<b>Output:</b><br>
<em>MyString=JavaObject(java.lang.String_924598)</em>

<p>
      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc4.3">
4.3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Invoking a method</H3>
The method invoking mechanism is very similar to the object instantiation
mechanism. The mapping of datatypes remains the same. The exception mechanism is also
exactly same as that of constructing objects and classes.

<p>
First we determine the class of the given object. The
getConstructor method is replaced by <em>getMethod(methodName, parameterTypes)</em>
except that it takes in as the first argument a method name. Once the
method is determined, its return type is determined using the
<em>getReturnType().getName()</em> for the mapping of Prolog and Java datatypes
following the convention described earlier. If the return type is void the
value returned to Prolog will be the constant 'void'. To invoke the
required method (<em>the method we wish to invoke</em>) we call the obtained method's 
<em>invoke.(Object, parameterList)</em>
method and will return after conversion the return value for the given method.

<p>
To invoke static methods, first we determine whether the object passed as the
first argument is an instance of the class <b>Class</b>. If so, this is taken to be the
class whose method is to be searched, and the call to invoke looks like 
<em>invoke.(null, parameterList)</em><br><br>
<b>Example</b><br>
<em>invoke_java_method(Mystring,length,R)</em><br>
<b>Output:</b><br>
<em>R=5</em><br>
<b>Example</b><br>
<em>invoke_java_method(Mystring,toString,NewR)</em><br>
<b>Output:</b><br>
<em>NewR=hello</em>

<p>
        <H2><A NAME="tth_sEc5">
5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Limitations of Reflection</H2>
An important limitation of the reflection mechanism is that when we are
searching for a method or a constructor for a given class using the given
parameter types. The reflection package looks for exact matches. That means
if we have an object of class Sub and we pass it to a method, which
accepts as argument an object of class Super, which is Sub's super-class,
we are able to invoke such a method in normal Java, but in case of reflection 
our search for such a method would fail and we would be unable to 
invoke this method. The same situation occurs in the case for an  accepting an
<b>interface</b> method,  which actually means accepting all objects implementing the
<b>interface</b>. 
The problem arises in the first place because method could be overloaded
and Java decides, which method to call amongst overloaded methods at compile-time
and not at runtime. We discuss in the next section how the
Java compiler decides, which method  to call at compile time.

<p>
        <H2><A NAME="tth_sEc6">
6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Java Compile Time Solution</H2>
The steps involved in the determination of which method to call once we supply
the object whose method is to be invoked and the argument types.

      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc6.1">
6.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Finding the Applicable Methods</H3>
The methods that are applicable have the following two properties:

<UL>
<p>

<li> The name of the method is same as the call and the number of parameters is same 
as the arguments in the method call.

<li> The type of each argument can be converted to the type of corresponding parameter
by method invocation conversion.
</UL>
<p>
This broadly means that either the parameter's class is the same as 
the corresponding argument's Class, or that it is on the inheritance chain built from the argument's 
class upto <b>Object</b>. If parameter is an <b>interface</b>, the argument implements 
that interface. We refer to [<a href="#javaspec" name=CITEjavaspec>2</a>] for a detailed description of this mechanism.

      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc6.2">
6.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Finding the Most Specific Method</H3>
Informally, <b>method1</b> is more specific than <b>method2</b> if any 
invocation handled by <b>method1</b> can also be handled by <b>method2</b>.

<p>
More precisely, if the parameter types of method1 are M<sub>11</sub> to M<sub>1n</sub> and 
parameter types of method2 are M<sub>21</sub> to M<sub>2n</sub> method1 is more specific
then method2 if M<sub>1j</sub> can be converted to M<sub>2j</sub> for all<b>j</b> from <b>1</b> to <b>n</b>
by method invocation conversion.

<p>
      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc6.3">
6.3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Overloading Ambiguity</H3>
In case no method is found to be most specific then method invocation is ambiguous 
and a compile time error occurs.<br><br>
Example:<br>
Consider class A superclass of B and two methods with name m.<br><br>
<em>m(A,B)</em><br>
<em>m(B,A)</em><br><br>
Now an invocation which can cause the ambiguity is.<br><br>
<em>m(instance of B, instance of B)</em><br>

<p>
In this case both method are applicable but neither is the most specific as
<em>m(instance of A,instance of B)</em> can be handled only by first one while
<em>m(instance of B,instance of A)</em> can be handled only by second one i.e.
either of the method's all parameters can not be converted to other's
by method invocation conversion.

<p>
      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc6.4">
6.4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Example: Method Resolution at Compile time</H3>
Method resolution takes place at compile time in Java and is 
dependent on the code which, calls the method. This becomes clear from the 
following example.

<p>
Consider two classes Super and Sub where Super is superclass of Sub. Also 
consider class A with a method m and class Test with a method test, the code
for the classes looks like this:<br><br>
<b>Super.java</b>

<pre>
public class Super {}
</pre>
<b>Sub.java</b>

<pre>
public class Sub extends Super {}
</pre>
<b>A.java</b>

<pre>
public class A {
  public void m(Super s) { System.out.println("super");}
}
</pre>
<b>Test.java</b>

<pre>
public class Test {
  public static void test(){
    A a=new A();
    a.m(new Sub());
  }
}
</pre>
On invocation of method <em>test()</em> of class <b>Test</b>, method <em>m(Super)</em> of class <b>A</b> is
invoked and <b>super</b> is printed out. Let's assume that we change the definition of the
class <b>A</b> and overload the method <em>m(Super)</em> with method <em>m(Sub)</em> such that <b>A</b>
looks like this:<br><br>
<b>A.java</b>

<pre>
public class A {
  public void m(Super s) {System.out.println("super");}
  public void m(Sub s) {System.out.println("sub");}
}
</pre>
If we recompile, and run our test method again, we expect <b>sub</b> to be printed out
since <em>m(Sub)</em> is more specific than <em>m(Super)</em> but actually <b>super</b> is printed 
out. The fact is method resolution is done when we are compiling the file containing the
method call and when we compiled the class Test we had the older version of class A and Java had
done resolution based on that class A. We can get the expected output by recompiling class
Test, which now views the newer version of class A and does the resolution according to that,
and hence we get the expected output <b>sub</b>.

<p>
        <H2><A NAME="tth_sEc7">
7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Finding a Most Specific Method at Runtime</H2>
We will follow a simple algorithm. Let's assume that the  number of methods which are accessible 
and have same name and number of parameters as the call is <b>M</b> (small constant) and
the number of arguments in the call is <b>A</b> (a small constant). Let us assume that the maximum inheritance depth of 
the class of an argument from Object down to itself in the class hierarchy tree is <b>D</b>  (a small constant) 
It can be trivially shown that the complexity of our algorithm is bounded by <b>O(M * A * D)</b>.
Our algorithm mimics exactly the functionality of Java and the following example would 
run exactly the same on both Java and our interface, the only difference being that since Java does 
the resolution at compile time, in case of an ambiguous call Java would report a compile time error 
while we do the same thing at runtime and hence, throw an exception with
appropriate error message. So if class A looks like this:<br><br>
<b>A.java</b>

<pre>
public class A {
  public void m(Super s1,Sub s2) {System.out.println("super");}
  public void m(Sub s1, Super s2) {System.out.println("sub");}
}
</pre>
and the class Test looks like this:
<b>Test.java</b>

<pre>
public class Test {
  public static void test(){
    A a=new A();
    a.m(new Sub(),new Sub());
  }
}
</pre>
 then Java will  not compile class <b>Test</b> and give an error message. In our case there is no such
thing as the class <b>Test</b>, but the equivalent of the above code would look like follows:

<pre>
new_java_class('A',Aclass),
new_java_obj(Aclass,Aobject),
new_java_class('Sub',Subclass),
new_java_obj(Subclass,Subobject1),
new_java_obj(Subclass,Subobject2),
invoke_java_method(Aobject,m(Subobject1,Subobject2),Return).
</pre>
The result will be an ambiguous exception message and the goal failing with <b>no</b>.

<p>

This GUI has almost completely been implemented in Prolog using the
reflection API. A special builtin which, allows us to redirect output to a
string is used to interface default Prolog i/o to textfield/textarea etc.
The total Java code is less than 10 lines. Jinni provides, on the Java
side, a simple mechanism to call Prolog <em>Init.jinni(``Prolog command'')</em>. Since
we do not have references to different objects in the Java code, but everything is in the
Prolog code, we need a mechanism to communicate between Java's action-listener and Prolog.
Jinni's Linda blackboards have been used for this purpose [<a href="#tarau:dipcl99" name=CITEtarau:dipcl99>5</a>,<a href="#tarau:paam99" name=CITEtarau:paam99>7</a>]. 
Whenever an action takes place the Java side calls Jinni and does a out with a number for type 
of action on the blackboard by calling something like <em>Init.jinni(``out(a(1))'')</em>. On the Prolog side we 
have a thread waiting on the blackboard for input by doing an <em>in(a(X))</em>. After the out 
variable <b>X</b> gets unified with <b>1</b> and depending on this value, Prolog takes the 
appropriate action and again waits for a new input. Hence, we can make action events 
such as button clicks communicate with Prolog. The code for button ``send'' in 
the Appendix B shows exactly how this is done.

9</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Related Work</H2>
Here we discuss a few other approaches followed for interfacing Prolog to Java
using reflection or  the Java Native Interface (JNI), and also a Scheme interface to Java using reflection.
First, Kprolog's JIPL package provides an interesting API from Java to a C-based Prolog and 
has a more extensive API for getting and setting fields. It also maps C-arrays
to lists. The Kprolog's JIPL has dynamic type inference for objects, but the problem of method 
signature determination and overloading has not been considered in the package [<a href="#JIPL" name=CITEJIPL>3</a>].

<p>
SICStus Prolog actually provides two interfaces for calling Java from Prolog.
One is the JASPER interface which uses JNI  to call Java from a C-based Prolog. 
To obtain a method handle from the Java Native Interface requires  to 
specify the signature of the method explicitly. So JASPER requires the
user to specify as a string constant the signature of the method that the user wishes to call.
This transfers the burden of finding the correct method to the user [<a href="#sics" name=CITEsics>4</a>],
who therefore needs to know how to specify (sometimes intricate) method signatures as Strings.

<p>
SICStus Prolog also has another interesting interface for calling Java from Prolog as
a Foreign Resource. When using this interface the user is required to first declare the
method which he wants to call and only then can the user invoke it. Declaring a method requires the 
user to explicitly state the ClassName, MethodName, Flags, and its Return Type and Argument Types 
and map it to a Prolog predicate. Now the Prolog predicate can be used directly. This feature
makes the Java method call look exactly like a Prolog builtin predicate at runtime - which
keeps the underlying Java interface transparent to, for instance, a user of a library. 
(<em>This is very much similar to our old Builtin Registration and Execution mechanism,
with one difference: here registration or declaration is on the Prolog side, while we were
doing the same on Java side - for catching all errors at compile time.</em>) 
The interface still requires the programmer to explicitly specify types and 
other details as  the exact method signature [<a href="#sics" name=CITEsics>4</a>].

<p>
Kawa Scheme also uses Java reflection to call Java from Scheme. To invoke a method in
Kawa Scheme one  needs to specify the class, method, return type and argument types.
This gives a handle to call the method. Now the user can supply arguments and can call this method.
Again, the burden of selecting the method is left to the user as he specifies the method signature
[<a href="#kawa" name=CITEkawa>1</a>].

<p>
In our case, like JIPL and unlike other interfaces, we infer Java types from Prolog's dynamic
types. But unlike JIPL, and like with approaches explicitely specifying signatures, we are able to call methods
where the argument type is not exactly same as the parameter type. Hence, our approach mimics Java
exactly. The functionality is complete and the burden of specifying argument types is
taken away from the user.

<p>
        <H2><A NAME="tth_sEc10">
10</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Future Work</H2>
Future work includes  extending our API, as currently we do not support
getting and setting fields and arrays. Another interesting direction which is a consequence
of the development of a reflection based API, is the ability to quickly integrate Java applications.
We have shown the power of the API with the simple GUI application. Such
applications can be built either completely in Java with an API based on  methods to be
called from Prolog, or almost completely in Prolog using only the standard
packages of Java.

<p>
Jinni 2000 has support for <em>plugins</em> such as different
Network Layers (TCP-IP and multicast sockets, RMI, CORBA) 
and a number applications such as Teleteaching, Java3D animation tolkit developped with its
conventional builtin interface. New applications and plugins can now be added by
writing everything in Prolog while using various Java libraries. Arguably,
the main advantage of such an interface is that it requires a minimal learning effort
from the programmer.

<p>
        <H2><A NAME="tth_sEc11">
11</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</H2>
We have described a new reflection based
Prolog to Java interface which takes advantage of implicit
dynamic type information on both the Prolog and the Java sides.
Our interface has allowed to automate data
conversion between overloaded method parameters,
through a new algorithm which finds the most specific
method corresponding to a Prolog call.
The resulting run-time reflective method dispatching mechanism provides
accurate handling of overloaded methods beyond the reflection
package's limitations, and is powerful enough to support
building a complete GUI library mostly in Prolog, with 
only a few lines of application specific Java code.

<p>
The ideas behind our interfacing technique are not specific to
Jinni 2000 - they can be reused in improving C-based Prolog-to-Java
interfaces like JIPL or Jasper or even Kawa's Scheme interface. Actually
our work is reusable for any languages with dynamic types,
interfacing to Java, as our work can be seen as just 
making Java's own Reflection package more powerful.
