XML Based Syntax Ecodings for Prolog

We describe mapping from Prolog programs to
XML documents. The syntax assumes a fixed
set of operators - but otherwise includes
all essential Prolog constructs and 
supports bidirectional translation to/from
ISO Prolog syntax.

Similar to the effort to provide XML-encodings
for other tree-structured languages (for instance
VRML) our encoding provides means for logic
programming components to excahnge data and
interoperate with mainstream tools and languages
like Java and .NET.

A dual interpretation of our effort is to provide
an inference mechanism which empowers XML-encoded
business logic with knowledge processing
capabilities.
