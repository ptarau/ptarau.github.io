<B>Abstract</B>
<P>
The tutorial is intended to introduce logic programmers to advanced
Internet programming. Our tools, encapsulated in a small set of very
high-level primitives, will enable the participants to program basic
client-server applications in a few lines of code, interact with http
servers and Java applets, and put on the Web their favorite programs.
<P>
The tutorial also gives a glimpse on mobile code and
multi-agent programming with special emphasis on using essential Prolog
features like meta-programming  
to implement complex remote execution
mechanisms, while language extensions like hypothetical assumptions and
Linda coordination primitives are used to elegantly deal with the
complexities of network and agent programming, at a very high level. 
Mobile threads are implemented by capturing 
first order continuations
in a compact data structure sent over the network.
Code is fetched lazily from its original base turned into a server
as the continuation executes at the remote site.
Combined with a dynamic recompilation scheme
ensuring that heavily used code moves up smoothly in a speed
hierarchy, our techniques are shown to be
an effective means for implementing mobile agents in a natural
programming style.
<P>
We will also describe our experience with building a comprehensive
Internet programming infrastructure [<A HREF="html.html#TDBwetice97">3</A>]
on top of <B>BinProlog</B> [<A HREF="html.html#Tarau97BinProlog">2</A>]
and its Java peer - a multithreaded unification based Linda
client and server, using Prolog terms and unification
for associative search.
<P>
Among the applications, we review 
LogiMOO[<A HREF="html.html#lpnet96virtual">5</A>, <A HREF="html.html#TDRB97chi">4</A>], 
a shared multi-user virtual world prototype 
with a controlled natural language interface,
executing under Java and VRML enabled browsers like Netscape
Communicator.
<P>
The tutorial is organized around a set of ``how to do it'' examples,
among which the following:
<P>

<UL><LI> simple CGI-scripts, client-server applications on the WWW
<LI> a multi-user chat program
<LI> an applet: from Prolog to Java and back
<LI> distributed programming with BinProlog engines and threads
<LI> mobile code: ``take the continuation and run''
<LI> LogiMOO: crafting shared virtual objects on the Web
<LI> Talking to VRML: BinProlog-driven 3D-avatar animation
</UL>

<P>
We conclude with an analysis of the practical application development
and promising future directions of work.
With the paradigm shift to highly inter-connected computers and programming
tools, logic programming languages have a unique opportunity to contribute
to practical Internet application development. Simplicity, robustness, 
automatic memory management,
code and object mobility
[<A HREF="html.html#migratory">1</A>]
are among the
features some LP languages [<A HREF="html.html#DOZmobs">6</A>, <A HREF="html.html#TDBwetice97">3</A>]
share with emerging tools like Java. Superior
meta-programming and high-level networking, built-in
grammars and dynamic databases, 
declarative semantics are among their
competitive advantages.
In this context, we discuss some strategies about how to integrate
this technology in the (real!) world of software development.
