<P CLASS=ABSTRACT><EM>LogiMOO is a BinProlog-based
Virtual World running under Netscape and Explorer
for distributed group-work
over the INTERNET and user-crafted virtual
places, virtual objects and agents.
LogiMOO is implemented on top of a 
multi-threaded blackboard-based logic programming
system (BinProlog) featuring
Linda-style coordination. Virtual blackboards
allow efficient mirroring and real-time
responsiveness over TCP/IP links,
while threads ensure high-performance
local client-server dynamics.
Embedding in Netscape allows advanced VRML and
HTML frame-based navigation and
multi-media support, while LogiMOO handles
virtual presence and acts as a
very high-level multi-media object broker. 
User-friendliness is achieved through a 
controlled English interface written in
terms of Assumption Grammars. Its language
coverage is extensible in that the user can 
incorporate new nouns, verbs and adjectives 
as needed by changes in the world. Immediate evaluation 
of world knowledge by the parser yields
representations which minimize the unknowns. 
We take advantage of the relative simplicity of 
controlled language to provide as well an
easy adaptation to other natural languages
than English, with English-like representations
as a universal interlingua.

<P>
MUDs and MOOs (Multi User Domains - Object Oriented) first introduced
virtual presence and interaction in the context of games.  Their direct descendents, Virtual
Worlds, provide a strong unifying metaphor for various forms of net-walk,
net-chat, and Internet-based virtual presence in general. They start
where usual HTML shows its limitations: they do have state and require
some form of virtual presence. ``Being there'' is the first step
towards full virtualization of concrete ontologies, from entertainment
and games to schools and businesses.
<P>
Some fairly large-scale projects (Intel's Moondo, Sony's Cyber
Passage, Black Sun's CyberGate, Worlds Inc.'s WorldChat)  converge  
towards a common interaction metaphor: an avatar represents each
participant in a multi-user virtual world. Information exchange reuses
our basic intuitions, with almost instant <EM>learnability</EM> for free.
<P>
The sophistication of their interaction metaphor, with VRML landscapes
and realistic `avatars' moving in shared multi-user virtual spaces,
will soon require  high-level agent programming tools, once the initial
fascination with `looking' human is not enough, and the automation of
complex behavior becomes the next step.  Towards this end, high-level coordination and
deductive reasoning abilities are among the most important additions
to various virtual world modeling languages.
<P>
Presently, despite their graphical sophistication, virtual worlds do
not allow <EM>controlling</EM> behavior and object creation
i.e., ``programming with words''.  Yet their characteristics favor the
use of natural language: each virtual world represents a particular
domain of interest, so that its associated relevant subset of language
is naturally restricted; and the command language into which natural
language sentences would have to be parsed is formal and
straightforward enough while being already relatively close to natural
language.
<P>
In this article we present our work towards these goals, based on a
set of embeddable logic programming components. Section <A HREF="html.html#logimoo">2</A>
describes LogiMOO, a virtual world with natural language capabilities
that makes use of linear and intuitionistic assumption
techniques. Section <A HREF="html.html#coord">2.1</A> describes the coordination aspect;
section <A HREF="html.html#kernel">2.2</A>, the LogiMOO kernel; section <A HREF="html.html#agent">2.3</A>
describes our agent model; section <A HREF="html.html#netscape">2.4</A> presents LogiMOO as
a Netscape application; section <A HREF="html.html#beyond">2.5</A> proposes a web of MOOs
allowing LogiMOO access to Netscape based users with no access to
BinProlog.  Section <A HREF="html.html#natint">3</A> describes the main features of
LogiMOO's natural language interface: coverage, dynamic knowledge
handling, multisentential anaphoric reference, extensibility within
the same language and to other languages, immediate evaluation, and
our positional treatment of nouns. The last three sections
respectively discuss related work, future work, and our conclusions.

LogiMOO [<A HREF="html.html#DPT96PAP">11</A>, <A HREF="html.html#lpnet96virtual">23</A>, <A HREF="html.html#inap96">19</A>] is a BinProlog-based
Virtual World running under Netscape for distributed group-work
over the Internet and user-crafted virtual places, virtual objects and
agents.  Netscape is used to implement CGI-based BinProlog
<EM>remote toplevel</EM> interacting with a remote LogiMOO server
(Fig. <A HREF="html.html#net">1</A>).  Objects in LogiMOO are represented as hyper-links
(URLs) towards their owners' home pages where their `native'
representation actually resides in various formats (HTML, VRML, GIF,
JPEG etc.).  Embedding in
Netscape allows advanced VRML or HTML frame-based navigation and
multi-media support, while LogiMOO handles virtual presence and acts
as a very high-level universal object broker.
<P>
The LogiMOO kernel behaves as any other MOO while offering a choice
between interactive Prolog syntax and a Controlled English parser
allowing people unfamiliar with Prolog to get along with the basic
activities of the MOO: place and object creation, moving from one
place to the other, giving/selling virtual objects, talking (`whisper'
and `say').

<STRONG> 1:</STRONG> LogiMOO on the Web<BR>
<P>
<P>
In order to achieve this, we have incorporated natural language
consultation capabilities into LogiMOO (see section <A HREF="html.html#natint">3</A>).  Our natural language
front-end is extensible in the sense that it is easy for the user to
tailor it to a particular virtual world through defining the verbs
specific to that world and establishing links between lexical objects
and their WWW representations. These definitions are done in
user-friendly terms, with the system being responsible for their
integration into the rest of the grammar and for their correspondence
with actual LogiMOO objects and actions.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00021000000000000000">Coordination: Linda and beyond</A></H2>
 <A NAME="coord">&#160;</A>
<P>
LogiMOO is built upon Multi-BinProlog [<A HREF="html.html#kdb93d">8</A>, <A HREF="html.html#kdb93c">10</A>], i.e.,
BinProlog enriched with a Linda-like tuple space.  Virtual
blackboards [<A HREF="html.html#dbt95a">9</A>] allow efficient mirroring of remote sites
over TCP/IP links while Solaris 2.x threads ensure high-performance
local client-server dynamics. The Multi-BinProlog blackboard is not
just an add-on, but is really integrated in the BinProlog environment,
featuring backtracking, guarded evaluation, etc.
<P>
A blackboard's basic characteristics are (i) it is persistent,
(ii) the data are manipulated associatively (i.e., based on their
content, rather than on their address), (iii) all accesses are
automatically synchronized. These are precisely the requirements for a
MOO: the status of the MOO should be stored somewhere, and it should
not be volatile; if we are looking for a particular object in a MOO,
we will always refer to it with a name, never with its address
location; a MOO is multi-user, so it should be synchronized at any
time.
<P>
The basic operations on the blackboard are: blackboard creation and
deletion, the creation of processes (independently running Prolog
goals), putting Prolog terms on the blackboard, removing terms from
the blackboard and checking the presence of terms. Both the get and
the read primitives can be blocking or non-blocking. Furthermore,
there are some more advanced primitives like blackboard operations
working on lists of terms instead of one term, operations to collect
the complete contents of a blackboard, and so on.
<P>
LogiMOO's primitive operations are implemented on top of
Multi-BinProlog's Linda-style operations [<A HREF="html.html#Tarau97BinProlog">20</A>].  We
refer to [<A HREF="html.html#DPT96PAP">11</A>, <A HREF="html.html#lpnet96virtual">23</A>] for a description of the
wide variety of <EM>blocking</EM> and <EM>non-blocking</EM> as well as <EM>
non-deterministic</EM> blackboard operations (backtracking through
alternative answers). For reasons of embeddability in multi-paradigm
environments and semantic simplicity we have decided to drop
non-determinism and return to a subset close to the original Linda
operators (combined with unification), and a simple client-server
architecture (although LogiMOO's design is now rapidly evolving
towards a `web of interconnected worlds').  This turned out to be
enough for simple (one-thread) agent programming.
<P>

<PRE><TT> 
<TT>out(X)</TT> 		 puts X on the server
<P>
<TT>in(X)</TT> 		  waits until it can take an object matching X from the server

</TT></PRE>
<P>
The presence of the <TT>all/2</TT> collector compensates for the lack of
non-deterministic operations.  Note that the only blocking operation
is <TT>in/1</TT>, and that that blocking <TT>rd/1</TT> is easily emulated in terms
of <TT>in/1</TT> and <TT>out/1</TT>. Non-blocking <TT>rd/1</TT> is
emulated with <TT>all/2</TT> (see also Figure <A HREF="html.html#linda">2</A>).

 <A NAME="kernel">&#160;</A>
<P>
<EM>Verbs</EM> available in the MOO are defined through a set of Prolog
predicates hiding the complexities of the distributed communication
model through the usual metaphors: places (starting from a default
lobby), ports, ability to `move' or teleport from one place to
another, a wizard resident on the server, ownership of objects, the
ability to transfer ownership and a built-in notifier agent watching
for messages as a background thread.
<P>
Non-shared information is kept on the default local blackboard.  The
login procedure simply puts the name of the current user on the local
blackboard, after enforcing unique identity on the server by sending a
password to the server together with the name.
<P>
<TT>Whereami(P)</TT> unifies
<TT>P</TT> with the location of the user's avatar.
<P>
Locally the name chosen by the user
is accessible as:
<P>
 <PRE>whoami(X):-local_rd(i_am(X)).
</PRE>
<P>
The use of local
blackboards allows high-speed access to private state information
and allow implementation of security protocols.
<P>
To conditionally
create a place (unless it exists) we use: <TT>dig(Place)</TT>.  To
create a port (only when the links are already existing places), we
use: <TT>port(P1,Dir,P2)</TT>.  To ``Teleport'' <TT>O</TT> from
<TT>P1</TT> to <TT>P2</TT>, we use: <TT>move(O,P1,P2)</TT>.
<P>
 <PRE>move(O,P1,P2):-cin(contains(P1,O)),out(contains(P2,O)).
</PRE>
<P>
On top of teleporting, we implement <TT>go(Dir)</TT>, <TT>
craft(O)</TT> (which creates virtual objects with ownership), and
<TT>give(Who, What)</TT>.
<P>
 <PRE>go(Dir):-
  whereami(Place),
  rd(port(Place,Dir,NewPlace)),
  whoami(Me),
  move(Me,Place,NewPlace),
  forall(has(Me,O),move(O,Place,NewPlace)).
</PRE>
<P>
Note that <TT>forall/2</TT> can be used to make someone's
belongings follow him. As in the real world,
this is usually done selectively on a subset of a
user's belongings.
<P>
Creating things with <TT>craft/1</TT> marks them with ownership:
<P>
 <PRE>craft(O):-whoami(Me),
  rd(contains(Place,Me)),
  out(contains(Place,O)),
  out(has(Me,O)).
</PRE>
<P>
Property transfer (useful for online sales and banking)
is prototyped as follows:
<P>
 <PRE>gives(From,To,O):-
  cin(has(From,O)),
  out(has(To,O)).

give(Who,What):-
   whoami(Me),
   cin(has(Me,What)),
   out(has(Who,What)).
</PRE>
<P>
Although expressing a <TT>sale</TT> predicate in terms
of give is easy, realistic transactions need a
sound security system, not yet implemented in LogiMOO<A NAME="tex2html3" HREF="#320"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="icons//foot_motif.gif" width="15" height="15"></A>.
<P>
Finally, <TT>look/0</TT> recognizes specific 
objects and shows them in the
most useful form. For instance, under the Netscape interface, users
are shown as hyper-links to their home pages and objects created by a
given user are shown as links relative to the user's home page.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00023000000000000000">The agent model</A></H2>
 <A NAME="agent">&#160;</A>
We define an <EM>agent</EM> as being a set of <EM>behaviors</EM>, as well as
the usual code for logical inferences and arithmetics.  Each behavior
is usually attached to its own thread, although thread sharing
mechanisms can be used on some machines for actual implementations.
An agent <EM>`located'</EM> in a container is called an <EM>avatar</EM>.
<P>
Agents performing actions on objects can either <EM>fail</EM>, <EM>
succeed</EM>, <EM>wait</EM> (to succeed) or <EM>warn</EM> about an <EM>error</EM>
or <EM>exception</EM>.
<P>
The notifier is one of the simplest possible <EM>agents</EM>.  It is
automatically started from the login predicate as a background thread
with <TT>run(notifier(Name))</TT>. The notifier's thread blocks until
<TT>in(mes_to(Name,Mes,From))</TT> succeeds and the notifier simply
outputs the message.
<P>
<PRE>  notifier(Name) :-
    in(mes_to(Name,Mes,From)),
    notify(Mes,From),
    notifier(Name).
</PRE>
<P>
The evaluation of <TT>whisper/2</TT>, defined as
<P>

<PRE>whisper(To,Mes) :- whoami(Me),out(mes_to(To,Mes,Me)).
</PRE>
<P>
unblocks the matching <TT>in(mes_to(Name,Mes,From))</TT>,
and consequently the notifier outputs the message with <TT>
notify(Mes,From)</TT>.  More generally, distributed event processing is
implemented by creating a `watching' agent for a given pattern.
<P>
<EM>Remote processing</EM> (Java-style) as well as security
mechanisms are expressed easily, by creating `command server' thread:
<P>
<PRE>  % remote processing request
  please(Who,What) :-
    whoami(Requester),
    out(please(Who,Requester,What)),
    whisper(Who,'Please'(What)).

  % a remote command processor
  command_server :-
    whoami(Me),
    repeat,
      in(please(Me,Requester,What)),
      ( friend_of(Me,Requester)-&gt;call(What),fail
      ; errmes(intruder(remote_action_attempted),Requester)
      ),
    fail.
</PRE>
<P>
Clearly, <TT>command_server</TT> and <TT>
notifier</TT> threads can be seen as `behavior components' of a unique
agent.  Moreover, they actually might cooperate in a synchronized way
as each <TT>please/2</TT> command triggers a <TT>whisper/2</TT>
action to be served by a notifier later.
<P>

<P>
Objects in LogiMOO<A NAME="tex2html5" HREF="#197"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="icons//foot_motif.gif" width="15" height="15"></A>  are
represented as hyper-links (URLs) towards their owners' home pages
where their ``native'' representation actually resides in various
formats (HTML, VRML, GIF, JPEG, etc.).
<P>
LogiMOO redefines the Prolog toplevel for interacting with
Multi-BinProlog either through telnet/rlogin<A NAME="tex2html6" HREF="#198"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="icons//foot_motif.gif" width="15" height="15"></A>
BinProlog's pipe-based lightweight Tcl/Tk interface, or through the
Web with Netscape .  The Web interface uses extensively the latest
Netscape goodies:
<P>
<UL><LI> Netscape  frames and forms
<LI> Cosmo Player or Live3D  plug-in for VRML navigation
<LI> JavaScript to help BinProlog control Netscape frames `from within'
<LI> BinProlog-based lightweight CGI-scripts
</UL>
<P>
Netscape-based users are recognized as special as they do not keep
local state (except for their name, password, and home page kept in the
form itself). The stateless CGI Multi-BinProlog client spawn by a
``submit&quot; Netscape action connects to a local persistent LogiMOO
server.  Compilation to C and shared dynamically linked libraries make
using BinProlog competitive with Perl scripting.
<P>
The server periodically saves its state to a file, through a separate
background thread while staying responsive to users. A
telnet/rlogin-based ``wizard'' console helps monitoring LogiMOO from a
remote computer.
<P>
The figure <A HREF="html.html#virtualbb">3</A> shows the embedding of LogiMOO as a
frame-based Netscape application.
<P>
<P><A NAME="322">&#160;</A><BR>
<STRONG> 3:</STRONG> LogiMOO as a frame-based Netscape application<A NAME="virtualbb">&#160;</A><BR>
<P>
<P>
Queries are submitted through the CGI POST method. BinProlog reads the
standard input using the <TT>CONTENT_LENGTH</TT> environment variable
and after a small filter cleans up hexadecimal escapes, it extracts
the actual query and its variables through a
list-of-characters-to-term conversion.  Finally, using a simple trick,
we map HTML query syntax to Prolog without any application specific
parsing:
<P>
<PRE>  :-op(1199,xfy,(&amp;)).

  (login=L &amp; passwd=P &amp; home=H &amp; query=Query) :-
    login(L,P,H),sit,
    metacall(Query).
</PRE>
<P>
Objects `crafted' by users are shown as URL's, relative to their
homes. This allows users to `put' into LogiMOO objects of various
formats (VRML, JPEG, WAV, AU) and gives multi-media capabilities for
free.  LogiMOO keeps the link while the actual object resides on the
user's computer accessible by clicking on a link.  This makes the link
`hot' so that the user is free to update the actual object without
having to notify LogiMOO.
<P>
We can even give the illusion that BinProlog commands from within
LogiMOO actually allow arbitrary Web navigation through use of a
JavaScript `one-liner', dynamically generated as answer to a query:
<P>
<PRE>  auto_show(URL,File) :-
    make_cmd(['&lt;body
       onLoad=&quot;window.open(''',URL,'/',File,''',''_self'')&quot;&gt;'],Cmd),
    writeln([Cmd]).
</PRE>
<P>
For instance, typing:
<P>
<PRE>  auto_show('http://eve.info.umoncton.ca:8080/~logimoo','lobby.wrl')
</PRE>
<P>
in the LogiMOO Prolog query text area, will instantly
show LogiMOO's VRML lobby in the Netscape  output frame, from where
the user can further explore links independently. Return to LogiMOO is
achieved simply by by clicking on the `VRML' floor of the room.  By
using the <TT>_parent</TT> Netscape pseudo-target instead of <TT>
_self</TT> the full window is replaced.  With <TT>_blank</TT> or a named
new target an additional Netscape browser is spawned, allowing
independent navigation, while keeping LogiMOO on-screen.
<P>
Clearly, achieving exclusively in Prolog or any other existing LP or
CLP the equivalent of what we have developed in about 1-man/month
total programming time would require a significant effort.  We are
more and more convinced that embedding logic programming tools in a
multi-paradigm environment can compensate for their lack of advanced
visual and Internet programming abilities and, ultimately, make them
competitive for commercial development despite their small `market
share'.
<P>
As an embedded application, LogiMOO acts as a broker between various
multi-paradigm, multi-media Netscape components. It therefore keeps (a
minimum amount of) state and user information.  Its full Prolog
command language gives arbitrary extensibility through objects and
agents.  Although file transfers and various protocols are
implementable with the underlying Multi-BinProlog system, we have
chosen to represent non-symbolic objects as hyper-links towards their
owner's WWW home.  Our design philosophy was to duplicate as little
existing components as possible while achieving as much functionality
as possible.  At some point, we expect that LogiMOO will grow by
itself through user extensions, much more than our own development
effort, as a truly open virtual world, together with its present and
future VRML and Java-centric cousins.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00025000000000000000">Beyond Linda: a Web of MOOs</A></H2>
<A NAME="beyond">&#160;</A>
<P>
Clearly, representing places with separate blackboards and
avatars/objects with processes/terms on local and remote blackboards
is the most natural representation, especially when thinking in terms
of a distributed `web of MOOs'. We will describe the basic ideas
behind LogiMOO in terms of a simpler mapping reminiscent from
client/server architectures, which also allows Netscape based users
not having BinProlog on their own computers to access LogiMOO.  The
`world' is represented by a blackboard on a server.  Virtual
blackboards that `mirror' the `world' on client processes are used if
the user has a copy of LogiMOO locally.  Otherwise, connectionless
Netscape `hits' from the user's computer create short-lived CGI
clients on the computer hosting the server<A NAME="tex2html8" HREF="#220"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="icons//foot_motif.gif" width="15" height="15"></A>.
<P>
Multi-BinProlog blackboards come in two flavors [<A HREF="html.html#dbt95a">9</A>]:
there are local blackboards, primarily used for efficient
communication and synchronization between processes running on the
same (multi-)processor, and there are virtual blackboards that are
primarily used for communication with processes running on other
machines. A virtual blackboard is a kind of alias, or link to another
(remote) blackboard. Logically, it cannot be distinguished from the
remote blackboard itself. At the implementation level, a virtual
blackboard does not contain data, but is just a local representation
of the remote blackboard. All operations issued on a virtual
blackboard are automatically forwarded to the remote
blackboard. Furthermore, the remote blackboard can in turn be a
virtual blackboard pointing to yet another remote blackboard. The last
blackboard in a chain must always be a physical blackboard containing

The first version of LogiMOO has been built upon
Multi-BinProlog [<A HREF="html.html#kdb93d">8</A>, <A HREF="html.html#kdb93c">10</A>], i.e., BinProlog enriched with a
Linda-like tuple space.  The current version (which also interconnects
with a new Java based multi-threaded Linda server) uses BinProlog's
built-in Linda subsystem based on Unix and Winsock compatible
platform independent socket operations.
<P>
A pure Linda-based language is not immediately suitable to support a
MOO because a Linda-application consists of a number of processes that
are created by one application in order to solve a given
problem. Here, client processes must be able to connect and disconnect
at any time. This requirement can be completely fulfilled by the
concept of virtual blackboard. A client wanting to connect with a MOO,
creates a local virtual blackboard, hooks it up to the MOO, and from
then on, it can interact with the MOO in an unconstrained way by
communicating with the local virtual blackboard.
<P>
To ensure interoperability between Windows 95 PCs and Unix machines we
have conservatively implemented a generic socket package with
operations specialized towards support for Linda operations and remote
execution.  A master server on a `well-known' host/port is used to
exchange identification information among peers composed of a client
and a `multiplexing' server. We refer
to [<A HREF="html.html#TDBwetice97">21</A>] for more details on the underlying BinProlog based 
Internet infrastructure used in the implementation of LogiMOO.
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000">The natural language interface</A></H1>
 <A NAME="natint">&#160;</A>
<P>
LogiMOO is one of the very few existing virtual worlds that can be
controlled with natural language. The reason why we wanted to provide 
LogiMOO with a NL interface is fourfold:
<OL><LI> natural language is the most convenient way for us
to communicate;
<LI> a natural language interface is the first step towards
 voice-controlled interaction with the virtual 
world<A NAME="tex2html9" HREF="#234"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="icons//foot_motif.gif" width="15" height="15"></A>;
<LI> a virtual world is a perfect environment to experiment
with natural language because the domain of discourse is
limited;
<LI> natural language demonstrates one of the strengths of
Prolog for Web-programming, not easily matched in other
programming or scripting languages.
</OL>
<P>
The peculiar features of the world to be consulted- a virtual world-
induced novel parsing features which are interesting in themselves:
flexible handling of dynamic knowledge, immediate evaluation of noun phrase
representations, allowing us to be economic with representation itself, 
inference of some basic syntactic categories from the context, a treatment
of nouns as proper nouns, easy extensibility within the same language
as well as into other natural languages. We shall examine each of these 
features in turn, after describing our natural language coverage.
<P>
It is interesting that the use of these features results in a 
completely deterministic parser (no backtrack).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00031000000000000000">Language coverage</A></H2>
<P>
Since LogiMOO handles mostly commands, outermost sentences will be
imperative sentences. In these, the subject (the avatar that the user
is controlling) is usually left implicit (notice however that embedded
sentences, such as relative clauses, are descriptive rather than
imperative, and therefore do include a subject). The user first enters
a set of imperative subjectless sentences, and this input is sent
through the parser to be converted into LogiMOO kernel predicates
which are then executed to complete the actions.  Verbs in the LogiMOO
environment represent actions that can take place in the virtual
world.
<P>
Because they are in imperative form, with their
subject left implicit, LogiMOO sentences reduce to verb phrases, which can be
of the following forms:
<P>
<EM>
<BLOCKQUOTE> An intransitive verb. <BR>
        A transitive verb followed by a noun. <BR>
        A transitive verb followed by a noun phrase. <BR>
        A transitive verb followed by a prepositional phrase. <BR>
        A bitransitive verb followed by two noun phrases. <BR>
        A bitransitive verb followed by a noun phrase and a prepositional phrase.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</EM>
<P>
A prepositional phrase is defined as
<P>
<EM>
<BLOCKQUOTE> A preposition followed by a noun phrase.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</EM>
<P>
The noun phrase forms allowed are
<P>
<EM>
<BLOCKQUOTE> A proper name. <BR>
        A pronoun (anaphora). <BR>
        A determiner followed by a noun.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</EM>
<P>
In addition, we identify communication inputs which occur when a user
wants their avatar to say, whisper or yell some message, e.g.,
<P>
<EM>
<BLOCKQUOTE> say hi how are you.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</EM>
<P>
This form of input is introduced by either:
<P>
<EM>
<BLOCKQUOTE> The word ``whisper'' followed by a prepositional phrase followed by a message. <BR>
        The word ``say'' followed by a message. <BR>
        The word ``yell'' followed by a message.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</EM>
<P>
Table <A HREF="html.html#sampleparses">1</A> shows some sample parses.
<P>
<P><A NAME="329">&#160;</A> <IMG WIDTH=535 HEIGHT=198 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="table249" SRC="img5.gif"  > <BR>
<STRONG> 1:</STRONG> Sample Parses<A NAME="sampleparses">&#160;</A><BR>
<P>
Notice that the last command in the table produces the name (i.e., ``car'') which designates
the object referred to by the noun
phrase. This name is obtained by consulting the world knowledge to
get the name of the
car that John crafted. Ambiguity re. which car is meant among
several in the world is avoided because the same name invoked by a different
user, or by the same user in a different room,  has a different  
representation internally. If, however, the user wants to craft more than one
car in the same room, each should be differently designated in the
command list (e.g., craft car1, give it to wizard, craft car2,
give it to Stephen).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00032000000000000000">Handling Dynamic Knowledge</A></H2>
<P>
Because virtual worlds are eminently constructive, their dynamic 
changes must be accommodated in a flexible yet discriminatory
manner. For instance, we must distinguish between <EM>static knowledge</EM>,
i.e. world knowledge
that exists before a user's sequence of world-changing commands, and 
<EM>dynamic knowledge</EM>, i.e. the new knowledge that results from 
those commands, since these may in some cases be tentative and subject
to revision.
<P>
Static knowledge is obtained previous to the parsing of a sequence of
natural language commands, through a small Prolog program which stores
the current state of the world in predicates such as <TT>is_avatar(X),
is_crafted(X)</TT>, etc.
<P>
Dynamic knowledge is created by execution of a natural language command,
and described with the aid of the same predicates as static knowledge,
but these are put on a blackboard instead of simply extending the
static world knowledge. Once the complete series of a user's commands
has been executed, with later commands possibly having revised the 
results of previous commands in the same interaction, the resulting 
blackboard information is made available to be used in the next iteration,
for gathering the state of the world before the next sequence of natural
language commands.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00033000000000000000">Multisentential Anaphoric Reference</A></H2>
<P>
Our system maintains yet another type of knowledge- <EM>hypothetical
knowledge</EM>, accessible only
by the parser, which helps it decide what parts of speech
should be related. In particular, the knowledge that noun phrases are potential referents
of an anaphora is kept through linear assumptions which
are consumed upon encountering, for instance, a pronoun which might 
refer to the noun phrase hypothesized as a referent. For
example,  while analyzing the sequence of commands: ``Craft a flower,
 give it to John'', the parser hypothesizes that ``flower'' might turn out
to be the
referent of some pronoun appearing somewhere in the rest of the discourse, and upon
 encountering
``it'', the right object (namely, ``flower'') is associated with this
pronoun. 
Although not shown above, gender and number information is also useful to check compatibility 
between a potential referent and an anaphora. A more complete analysis of
anaphoric resolution through Assumption Grammars can be found in
[<A HREF="html.html#DT97AGNL">7</A>].
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00034000000000000000">Language Extensibility</A></H2>
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION00034010000000000000">Within the same language</A></H4>
<P>
Our goal of language extensibility comes from the need to dynamically
introduce new concepts into the world, and with them, new vocabulary in
the analyzer. For instance, ``craft a gnu'' must be accepted even if
no gnus exist in the virtual world yet, and no corresponding entry
exists in the lexicon.
<P>
For this reason, our parser recognizes a noun from its context in
the sentence rather than from any lexical definition. Adjectives can be 
treated similarly, by requiring them to be used in controlled fashion, 
e.g. within relative clauses, as in ``a car that is red'', so that
the parser can infer adjectival function unequivocally from the 
word's position as an attribute. Note that since the world is described
in terms of physical metaphors, adjectives will refer to such properties
as color, shape, position, etc., and statements about them will in general
be conditionless clauses (facts).
<P>
Allowing verbs to be inferred from context is more difficult. The
syntactic definition part of defining new verbs can be done by
example, i.e. by gleaning from the user information re. number of
arguments from similarity with other proposed sample verbs, on which
the user would have to just click (e.g., ``smile'' as a sample
intransitive verb, ``look'' as a sample transitive verb, ``give'' as a
sample bitransitive verb, etc.). This allows user-friendliness by not
requiring the user to handle syntactic notions such as ``transitive''
or ``intransitive'', but instead leaving it to our interface to
invisibly replicate a similar lexical definition from the analogy with
existing sample words. But the predicates obtained from verbs as a
result of parsing cannot simply translate into a constant (as for most
nouns) or a unary predicate (as for most adjectives), since in
general, they must translate into n-ary predicates corresponding to
actions, and the verb being a new one, these actions can in general
require description through full Prolog clauses. Our present solution
is to require the user to provide a Prolog definition of the new
command that the new verb refers to. Future work will investigate
higher level solutions to this problem.
<P>
Of course, we can think of extending a grammar with
other types of words than nouns, verbs and adjectives. However, we
have chosen to focus on just these categories because they are the
most likely to be application-dependent, and because in the case of
verbs, they are the ones
that will induce corresponding new LogiMOO commands.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION00034020000000000000">Extensibility to other natural languages</A></H4>
<P>
Given that we  accept  only controlled language, and that some 
words, such as nouns and adjectives, do not need to be explicitly
defined in a lexicon, but are inferred by the system from their first use
in a command, we have a simple
way of adapting our English analyzer into other languages.
<P>
In order to parameterize the language, we record which language we are using
in the call, by means of an intuitionistic implication, e.g.:
<P>
<PRE>?- language(spanish)=&gt;parse([susurra,al,brujo]).
</PRE>
<P>
Lexical items will then be specialized according to the language, and will
still induce an English-based semantic representation.
<P>
In order to explain how our rules do this, let us first observe that
 there are two types of rules in the English grammar which are
 language dependent:
<P>
<UL><LI> rules that create a predicate name which is reminiscent of the noun, verb
 or adjective from which they spring,
<P>
<LI> rules containing a lexical item (i.e., a symbol preceded by <tex2html_verb_mark><tex2html_verb_mark>).
</UL>
<P>
 For rules of the first type, we shall maintain the English predicate name
regardless of the language of origin, as a kind of interlingua allowing
us to go from one language to another.
<P>
 For rules of the second type, we replace <tex2html_verb_mark><tex2html_verb_mark> by 
<tex2html_verb_mark><tex2html_verb_mark>), as in:
<P>
<PRE>  
 verb(give(X,Y)):- @give.
</PRE>
<P>
and then we define an English and alternative lexicons as follows: 
<PRE>  
 %English lexicon:     		   % Spanish lexicon:

 @give:- #give, -english.	   @give:-  #de, -spanish.
</PRE>
<P>
Notice that the language we're at is checked <EM>after</EM> the corresponding
word is found. This is to ensure speed, since in this way, the word to be parsed
will be recognized right away. In generation mode, we might want to switch
the order around.
<P>
 Of course, more realistically, we will need features such as gender and number
 in order to produce the right words in each language. For instance, whereas
 in English we have only one lexical form for the definite article, whether it
 is singular, plural, feminine or masculine, in Spanish we have four
 different lexical items covering all these forms.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00035000000000000000">Immediate Evaluation</A></H2>
<P>
Commands get processed, as we saw, after their translation into
formulas from their natural language expression. These formulas are
conjunctions of actions expressed as predicates, whose arguments are
constants representing objects, people, places, etc. These constants
are produced by evaluating noun phrases on the fly during the
parse. In other words, instead of generating a formula to represent a
noun phrase, its components will be evaluated right away to generate a
constant satisfying the noun phrase's description. For instance, if
the command sequence is that of the two last sentences shown in table
1, parsing of ``the car that john crafted'' will directly produce
``car'' (the constant representing the entity that john crafted)
rather than a descriptive formula such as ``crafted(john,X),
is_a(X,car)''.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00036000000000000000">Treatment of nouns</A></H2>
<P>
Because our system translates a noun into a constant
with same name, our treatment of nouns can be viewed as similar
to that of proper names.  As
mentioned earlier, internally a distinction will be made between cars
crafted by different users or by the same user in different rooms, but
when the same user wants to refer to two distinct noun referents in the
same room, a different noun name must be used for each, e.g. ``car1''
and ``car2''. Thus ambiguity is dealt with automatically without needing
to resort to the explicit construction of internal unique identifiers
for each object as is the case in many other systems. This makes object
referencing very direct and allows us to proceed to the immediate evaluation
of noun phrases described in the previous section. The resulting formulas are therefore
simpler.
<P>
Adjectives can also be recognized by context, as explained earlier, 
but will generate a predicate (e.g., red(X) from the adjective ``red'')
rather than a constant. This predicate, as we have seen, will evaluate
immediately rather than being inserted into the formula being constructed.
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION00040000000000000000">Related work</A></H1>
<P>
We do not know about other systems using logic programming for virtual
world simulation, although a large number of sophisticated Web-based
applications and tools are on the way to be implemented in LP/CLP
languages, for
instance [<A HREF="html.html#ch_html">5</A>, <A HREF="html.html#ld_www">15</A>, <A HREF="html.html#lpnet96cabeza">6</A>, <A HREF="html.html#lpnet96eclipse">4</A>, <A HREF="html.html#lpnet96multiple">18</A>, <A HREF="html.html#lpnet96light">14</A>].
The closest application with a clear virtual world flavor is the
Ubique Doors (tm) server [<A HREF="html.html#shapiro94WWW">16</A>] which shows (Flat
Concurrent) Prolog lists in log files although we do not know
 exactly how closely it is based on LP
technology.  This server, combined with the Sesame (tm) client
emulates co-presence and cooperative work at virtual places
implemented on top of existing Web pages and ftp directories.  On the
other hand applications of MOO technology usually combined with VRML
navigation are spreading quite fast. Among them, some of the most
impressive are:
<P>
<UL><LI> Sony's Cyber Passage, <TT>http://vs.sony.co.jp/VS-E/vstop.html</TT>,

<LI> SenseMedia's
The Sprawl, <TT>http://sensemedia.net/sprawl</TT>.
</UL>
<P>
Moreover, other declarative languages are starting to be
used for WWW applications.  The Carnegie Mellon FoxNET
project [<A HREF="html.html#fox">12</A>] implements a full featured Web server. 
Microsoft's Active
VRML proposal promises a declarative (purely functional) description
of 3D movement and behavior.
<P>
We have not found so far any MUD/MOO environments that handle NL
processing.  Other MUD/MOO environments fall into two general
categories.  Environments such as ``Moondo&quot; by Intel [<A HREF="html.html#moondo">13</A>],
``CyberGate&quot; by BlackSun [<A HREF="html.html#cybergate">3</A>], and ``Cyber Passage&quot; by
Sony [<A HREF="html.html#cyberpassage">17</A>], fall into the category of point and click
graphical environments.  These completely avoid the need for NL
processing as the only text involved seems to be that for chatting
with other avatars.  All movement and actions are completed with mouse
point and click actions.  The second category, in which environments
such as MediaMOO [<A HREF="html.html#mediamoo">2</A>] and the Avalon MUD [<A HREF="html.html#avalon">1</A>] fall
into, are text-based systems.  These systems lack NL processing and
focus on the use of pattern matching techniques to gather information.
<P>
Further, there is little work being done that is specific to the
advantages gained by connecting MUDs/MOOs to the World Wide Web using
logic programming such as the use of Prolog.  As such, objects in
LogiMOO are represented as hyper-links (URLs) towards their owners'
home pages where their `native' representation actually resides in
various formats (HTML, VRML, GIF, JPEG, etc.).  At the same time,
logic programming adds deductive database facilities in a uniform
framework, hypothetical reasoning tools (through Assumption Grammars),
and logic programming data and code use the same representation which
makes meta-programming easy.
<P>
Virtual Worlds technologies pioneered
by [<A HREF="html.html#cybergate">3</A>, <A HREF="html.html#cyberpassage">17</A>, <A HREF="html.html#alphaworld">24</A>, <A HREF="html.html#moondo">13</A>] are becoming part
of `standard setting' applications like Netscape Communicator or
Internet Explorer. Most of them concentrate on the interaction
metaphor and/or visualization without a principled approach to the
underlying coordination logic.
<P>
Compared to other currently known MUD/MOO environments, this interface
bridges the gap between those that are graphical based and those that
are pattern matching based.  By filling the gap, we are able to
provide the users with a natural form of textual interaction on which
graphical environments can still be built.
<P>
Although the current interaction is controlled completely through the
natural language interface, this does restrict efficiency of
maneuvering an avatar through the virtual worlds.

A Java based implementation, using a minimal set of logic programming
components (unification, associative search) is on its way. It will be
integrated in the existing LogiMOO framework on the server side. It
holds promise for smooth cooperation with existing Java class
hierarchies as well as various BinProlog based LogiMOO components.
<P>
A Java based Linda implementation, using a minimal set of logic
programming components (unification, associative search) has been
recently released (the Java TermServer, available at
<TT>http://clement.info.umoncton.ca/BinProlog</TT>).  It allows to communicate
bidirectionally with the existing LogiMOO framework, allowing creation
of combined Java/Prolog mobile-agent programs. In particular, Java
applets can be used as front-end in browsers instead of the more
resource consuming CGIs LogiMOO is currently based on.  It holds
promise for smooth cooperation with existing Java class hierarchies as
well as various BinProlog based LogiMOO components.
<P>
Intelligence and flexible metaprogramming on the logic programming
side combined with visualization and WWW programming abilities on the
Java side will allow easy component integration in various concrete
containers.
<P>
The LogiMOO system is currently being used in some
undergraduate classes as an enhancement to the class and as a testbed
for LogiMOO based virtual communities.  Future directions are to include LogiMOO as a tool for
virtual tele-education where distance education students and
instructors may use LogiMOO as a teaching/learning environment.
<P>
W.r.t. the natural language processing component, the next
logical step is the use speech recognition in order to interact
with LogiMOO and though it with other interoperable components
running under Netscape as, for instance, VRML plugins.
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION00060000000000000000">Conclusion</A></H1>
<P>
We have shown that Prolog with appropriate coordination language
extensions is a practical tool for virtual world simulation.
A synergy between MOOs, Linda-style coordination
and Prolog's powerful associative search and dynamic object
creation facilities could be expected.
Multi-BinProlog's threads and virtual blackboards
make this synergy possible.
A logic programming approach to MOO programming has the advantage
of having all the right tools within a unified environment.
Embedding in Netscape ensures implicit platform independence
of our server and seamless cooperation with present
and future third party Netscape tools.
<P>
We have also presented a natural language interface to LogiMOO which takes a controlled
form of English and translates it into LogiMOO kernel predicates which
are executed as actions in the virtual environment.  Pronominal
references in multisentential input are allowed. Extensibility within
the same language is achieved by inferring new nouns and adjectives from
their context in the sentences, and by a dialogue with the user that
allows new verbs and their corresponding LogiMOO actions to be described
in a user-friendly way. Extensibility into different natural 
languages is obtained
not through the usual machine translation approach, but by abstracting a 
core set of language independent rules from our English parser and then 
adding a language specific lexicon 
(currently available for English, French, Spanish) to complete the
grammar definition. A simple change of one lexicon module into another effects
the language change invisibly, so that users across the world can type in
their interactions in their own language, these are recorded in a ``neutral''
but invisible form, from which any retrieval continues to respect the language
of the caller.

<DL> <DT><A NAME="320">...LogiMOO</A><DD>
As usual, PGP-based public-key cryptography can ensure
secure transactions on top of an insecure carrier.
Although it is possible to implement electronic money
and authentication within LogiMOO on top of standard Solaris
tools like <TT>des_crypt</TT>, the embedding of LogiMOO in Netscape
(described in section <A HREF="html.html#netscape">2.4</A>),
allows use of high quality third-party
encryption and E-cash technology.

<PRE>
</PRE><DT><A NAME="198">...telnet/rlogin</A><DD>Users without
their own browser can access LogiMOO through a `Prolog shell' hosted
on our computers with a Unix-level guest account. Setting this up is
quite easy by replacing /bin/sh in /etc/passwd with a Multi-BinProlog
C-ified executable /opt/bin/mbp, customized to support LogiMOO.

</PRE><DT><A NAME="220">...server</A><DD>This has been
found very useful for teaching applications with low-end PCs.
<PRE>
</PRE><DT><A NAME="234">...world</A><DD>With operating systems as OS/2 Warp integrating 
basic voice recognition and products like Dragon Systems' continuous
unrestricted speech recognizer widely available, controlling software
as well as programming in a speech-friendly environment becomes
increasingly realistic.
